PyGPSClient is a free, open-source, multi-platform graphical GNSS/GPS testing, diagnostic and configuration application written entirely in Python and tkinter. 
* Runs on any platform which supports a Python 3 interpreter (>=3.10) and tkinter (>=8.6) GUI framework, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and Raspberry Pi OS.
* Supports NMEA, UBX, SBF, QGC, RTCM3, NTRIP, SPARTN, MQTT and TTY (ASCII) protocols¹.
* Capable of reading from a variety of GNSS data streams: Serial (USB / UART), Socket (TCP / UDP), binary data stream (terminal or file capture) and u-center (*.ubx) recording.
* Provides [NTRIP](#ntripconfig) and [SPARTN](#spartnconfig) client facilities.
* Can serve as an [NTRIP base station](#basestation) with an RTK-compatible receiver (e.g. u-blox ZED-F9P/X20P, Quectel LG290P, LG580P, LC29H or Septentrio Mosaic X5).
* Supports GNSS (*and related*) device configuration via proprietary UBX (e.g. u-blox NEO-F10, ZED-F9, ZED-X20), NMEA (e.g. Quectel LG290P/LG580P PQTM*, LC29H PAIR*) and ASCII TTY (e.g. Septentrio Mosaic X5, Feyman IM19) protocols.
* Can be installed using the standard `pip` Python package manager - see [installation instructions](#installation) below.

This is an independent project and we have no affiliation whatsoever with any GNSS manufacturer or distributor.

¹ *specific message support subject to underlying parser implementation*

## <a name="instructions">Instructions</a>

1. To connect to a GNSS receiver via USB or UART port, select the device from the listbox, set the appropriate serial connection parameters and click 
![connect icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/usbport-1-24.png?raw=true). The application will endeavour to pre-select a recognised GNSS/GPS device but this is platform and device dependent. Press the ![refresh](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-refresh-6-16.png?raw=true) button to refresh the list of connected devices at any point. `Rate bps` (baud rate) is typically the only setting that might need adjusting, but tweaking the `timeout` setting may improve performance on certain platforms. The `Msg Mode` parameter defaults to `GET` i.e., periodic or poll response messages *from* a receiver. If you wish to parse streams of command or poll messages being sent *to* a receiver, set the `Msg Mode` to `SET` or `POLL`. An optional serial or socket stream inactivity timeout can also be set (in seconds; 0 = no timeout).
1. A custom user-defined serial port can also be passed via the json configuration file setting `"userport_s":`, via environment variable `PYGPSCLIENT_USERPORT` or as a command line argument `--userport`. A special userport value of "ubxsimulator" invokes the experimental [`pyubxutils.UBXSimulator`](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyubxutils/blob/main/src/pyubxutils/ubxsimulator.py) utility to emulate a GNSS NMEA/UBX serial stream. 
1. To connect to a TCP or UDP socket, enter the server URL and port, select the protocol (defaults to TCP) and click 
![connect socket icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/ethernet-1-24.png?raw=true).
1. To stream from a previously-saved <a name="filestream">binary datalog file</a>, click 
![connect-file icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/binary-1-24.png?raw=true) and select the file type (`*.log, *.ubx, *.*`) and path. PyGPSClient datalog files will be named e.g. `pygpsdata-20220427114802.log`, but any binary dump of an GNSS receiver output is acceptable, including `*.ubx` files produced by u-center.
1. To disconnect from the data stream, click
![disconnect icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-media-control-50-24.png?raw=true).
1. Protocols Shown - Select which protocols to display; NMEA, UBX, SBF, QGC, RTCM3, SPARTN or TTY (NB: this only changes the displayed protocols - to change the actual protocols output by the receiver, use the [UBX Configuration Dialog](#ubxconfig)).
   - **NB:** Serial connection must be stopped before changing to or from TTY (terminal) protocol.
   - **NB:** Enabling TTY (terminal) mode will disable all other protocols.
1. Console Display - Select console display format (Parsed, Binary, Hex Tabular, Hex String, Parsed+Hex Tabular - see Console Widget below).
1. Tags - enable color tags in console (see Console Widget below).
1. Position Format and Units - Change the displayed position (D.DD / D.M.S / D.M.MM / ECEF) and unit (metric/imperial) formats.
1. Show Unused Satellites - Include or exclude satellites that are not used in the navigation solution (e.g. because their signal level is too low) from the graph and sky view panels.
1. DataLogging - Turn Data logging in the selected format on or off. On first selection, you will be prompted to select the directory into which timestamped log files are saved.
1. GPX Track - Turn track recording (in GPX format) on or off. On first selection, you will be prompted to select the directory into which timestamped GPX track files are saved.
1. Database - Turn spatialite database recording (*where available*) on or off. On first selection, you will be prompted to select the directory into which the `pygpsclient.sqlite` database is saved. Note that, when first created, the database's spatial metadata will take a few seconds to initialise (*up to a minute on Raspberry Pi and similar SBC*). **NB** This facility is dependent on your Python environment supporting the requisite [sqlite3 `mod_spatialite` extension](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) - see [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#prereqs) for further details. If not supported, the option will be greyed out. Check the Menu..Help..About dialog for an indication of the current spatialite support status.

     *FYI* a helper method `retrieve_data()` is available to retrieve data from this database - see [Sphinx documentation](https://www.semuconsulting.com/pygpsclient/pygpsclient.html#pygpsclient.sqllite_handler.retrieve_data) and [retrieve_data.py](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/examples/retrieve_data.py) example for details.
1. To save the current configuration to a file, go to File..Save Configuration.
1. To load a saved configuration file, go to File..Load Configuration. The default configuration file location is `$HOME/pygpsclient.json`. **NB** Any active serial or RTK connection must be stopped before loading a new configuration.

1. [Socket Server / NTRIP Caster](#socketserver) facility with two modes of operation: (a) open, unauthenticated Socket Server or (b) NTRIP Caster (mountpoint = `pygnssutils`).
1. [UBX Configuration Dialog](#ubxconfig), with the ability to send a variety of UBX CFG configuration commands to u-blox GNSS devices. This includes the facility to add **user-defined commands or command sequences** - see instructions under [user-defined presets](#userdefined) below. To display the UBX Configuration Dialog (*only functional when connected to a UBX GNSS device via serial port*), click
![gear icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-gear-2-24.png?raw=true), or go to Menu..Options..UBX Configuration Dialog.
1. [NMEA Configuration Dialog](#nmeaconfig), with the ability to send a variety of NMEA configuration commands to GNSS devices (e.g. Quectel LG290P). This includes the facility to add **user-defined commands or command sequences** - see instructions under [user-defined presets](#userdefined) below. To display the NMEA Configuration Dialog (*only functional when connected to a compatible GNSS device via serial port*), click
![gear icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-gear-2-24-brown.png?raw=true), or go to Menu..Options..NMEA Configuration Dialog.
1. [NTRIP Client](#ntripconfig) facility with the ability to connect to a specified NTRIP caster, parse the incoming RTCM3 or SPARTN data and feed this data to a compatible GNSS receiver (*requires an Internet connection and access to an NTRIP caster and local mountpoint*). To display the NTRIP Client Configuration Dialog, click
![ntrip icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-antenna-4-24.png?raw=true), or go to Menu..Options..NTRIP Configuration Dialog.
1. [SPARTN Client](#spartnconfig) facility with the ability to configure an IP or L-Band SPARTN Correction source and SPARTN-compatible GNSS receiver (e.g. ZED-F9P) and pass the incoming correction data to the GNSS receiver (*requires an Internet connection and access to a SPARTN location service*). To display the SPARTN Client Configuration Dialog, click ![spartn icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-antenna-3-24.png?raw=true), or go to Menu..Options..SPARTN Configuration Dialog.
1. [GPX Track Viewer](#gpxviewer) utility with elevation and speed profiles and track metadata. To display the GPX Track viewer, go to Menu..Options..GPX Track Viewer.

#### <a name="config">Configuration settings</a>

- Configuration settings for PyGPSClient can be saved and recalled via the Menu..File..Save Configuration and Menu..File..Load Configuration options. By default, PyGPSClient will look for a file named `pygpsclient.json` in the user's home directory. Certain configuration settings require manual editing e.g. custom preset UBX, NMEA and TTY commands and tag colour schemes - see details below.

#### <a name="updates">Checking for the latest version</a>

- The About dialog (Menu..Help..About) includes a facility to check the latest available versions of PyGPSClient and its subsidiary modules, and initiate an automatic update. Tick the 'Check on startup' box to perform this check on startup (*note that this requires internet access, which may result in slower startup times on platforms with low bandwidth / high latency internet connections*). The facility may be unavailable in certain Homebrew-installed Python environments due to technical constraints.

#### <a name="refreshrate">GUI refresh rate setting</a>

- PyGPSClient processes all incoming GNSS data in 'real time' but, by default, the GUI is only refreshed every 0.5 seconds. The refresh rate can be configured via the `guiupdateinterval_f` setting in the json configuration file. **NB:** PyGPSClient may become unresponsive on slower platforms (e.g. Raspberry Pi) at high message rates if the GUI update interval is less than 0.1 seconds, though lower intervals (<= 0.1 secs) can be accommodated on more powerful platforms.

#### <a name="transient">Transient dialog setting</a>

- A boolean configuration setting `transient_dialog_b` governs whether pop-up dialogs are 'transient' (i.e. always on top of main application dialog) or not. The default setting of `0` allows pop-up dialogs to be minimised independently of the main application window, but be mindful that some dialogs may end up hidden behind others e.g. "Open file/folder" dialogs. **If a file open button appears unresponsive, check that the "Open file/folder" panel isn't already open but obscured**.

| User-selectable 'widgets' | To show or hide the various widgets, go to Menu..View and click on the relevant hide/show option. |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|![banner widget](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/banner_widget.png?raw=true)| Expandable banner showing key navigation status information based on messages received from receiver. To expand or collapse the banner or serial port configuration widgets, click the ![expand icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-arrow-80-16.png?raw=true)/![expand icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-triangle-1-16.png?raw=true) buttons. **NB**: some fields (e.g. hdop/vdop, hacc/vacc) are only available from proprietary NMEA or UBX messages and may not be output by default. The minimum messages required to populate all available fields are: NMEA: GGA, GSA, GSV, RMC, UBX00 (proprietary); UBX: NAV-DOP, NAV-PVT, NAV_SAT |
|![console widget](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/console_widget.png?raw=true)| Configurable serial console widget showing incoming GNSS data streams in either parsed, binary or tabular hexadecimal formats. Double-right-click to copy contents of console to clipboard. The scroll behaviour and number of lines retained in the console can be configured via the settings panel. Supports user-configurable color tagging of selected strings for easy identification. Color tags are loaded from the `"colortag_b":` value (`0` = disable, `1` = enable) and `"colortags_l":` list (`[string, color]` pairs) in your json configuration file (see example provided). If color is set to "HALT", streaming will halt on any match and a warning displayed. NB: color tagging does impose a small performance overhead - turning it off will improve console response times at very high transaction rates.|
|![skyview widget](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/skyview_widget.png?raw=true)| Skyview widget showing current satellite visibility and position (elevation / azimuth). Satellite icon borders are colour-coded to distinguish between different GNSS constellations. For consistency between NMEA and UBX data sources, will display GLONASS NMEA SVID (65-96) rather than slot (1-24). |
|![graphview widget](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/graphview_widget.png?raw=true)| Graphview widget showing current satellite reception (carrier-to-noise ratio or cnr). Double-click to toggle legend. |
|![world map](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/staticmap.png?raw=true)| Map widget with various modes of display - select from "map" / "sat" (online) or "world" / "custom" (offline). Select zoom level 1 - 20. Double-click the zoom level label to reset the zoom to 10. Double-right-click the zoom label to maximise zoom to 20. Tick Track to show track (track will only be recorded while this box is checked). Double-Right-click will clear the map. Map Type = 'world': a static offline Mercator world map showing current global location.
|![online map](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/webmap_widget.png?raw=true)| Map Type = 'map', 'sat' or 'hyb' (hybrid): Dynamic, online web map or satellite image via MapQuest API (*requires an Internet connection and free [Mapquest API Key](#mapquestapi)*). By default, the web map will automatically refresh every 60 seconds (*indicated by a small timer icon at the top left*). The default refresh rate can be amended by changing the `"mapupdateinterval_n":` value in your json configuration file, but **NB** the facility is not intended to be used for real-time navigation. Double-click anywhere in the map to immediately refresh. |
|![offline map](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/custommap.png?raw=true)| Map Type = 'custom': One or more custom geo-referenced offline maps can be imported using the Menu..Options..Import Custom Map facility, or by manually setting the `usermaps_l` field in the json configuration file. The `usermaps_l` setting represents a list of map paths and bounding boxes in the format ["path to map image", [minlat, minlon, maxlat, maxlon]] - see [example configuration file](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/pygpsclient.json#L281). Map images must be a [supported format](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) and use a standard WGS84 Web Mercator projection e.g. EPSG:4326. PyGPSClient will automatically select the first image whose extents encompass the current location, based on the order in which the maps appear in `usermaps_l`. NB: The minimum and maximum viable 'zoom' levels depend on the resolution and extents of the imported image and the user's display - if the zoom bounds exceed the image extents, the Zoom spinbox will be highlighted. |
|![import custom map](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/importcustommap.png?raw=true)| <a name="custommap">Import Custom Map dialog</a>. Click ![load icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-folder-18-24.png?raw=true) to open the custom map image location (*the default file suffix is `*.tif` - select Show Options to select any file suffix `*.*`*). If the `rasterio` library is installed and the image is geo-referenced (e.g. using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)), the map extents will be automatically extracted - otherwise they must be entered manually. Import the custom map path and extent settings by clicking ![play icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-arrow-12-24.png?raw=true). By default, the imported map will be appended to the existing list - click 'First?' to insert the map at the top of the list instead. See [Creating Custom Maps for PyGPSClient](https://www.semuconsulting.com/gnsswiki/custommapwiki/) for tips on how to create a suitable georeferenced map image.|
|![spectrum widget](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/spectrum_widget.png?raw=true)| Spectrum widget showing a spectrum analysis chart (*GNSS receiver must be capable of outputting UBX MON-SPAN messages*). Clicking anywhere in the spectrum chart will display the frequency and decibel reading at that point. Double-clicking anywhere in the chart will toggle the GNSS frequency band markers (L1, G2, etc.) on or off. Right-click anywhere in the chart to capture a snapshot of the spectrum data, which will then be superimposed on the live data. Double-right-click to clear snapshot. **NB:** Some receivers (e.g. NEO-F10N) will not output the requisite MON-SPAN messages unless the port baud rate is at least 57,600. |
|![sysmon widget](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/sysmon_widget.png?raw=true)| System Monitor widget showing device cpu, memory and I/O utilisation (*GNSS receiver must be capable of outputting UBX MON-SYS and/or MON-COMMS messages*).

## <a name="ubxconfig">UBX Configuration Facilities</a>

![ubxconfig widget screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/ubxconfig_widget.png?raw=true)

**Pre-Requisites:**

- u-blox GNSS receiver e.g. u-blox NEO-M8S, ZED-F9P, etc. connected to the workstation via USB or UART port.

**Instructions:**

The UBX Configuration Dialog currently provides the following UBX configuration panels:
1. Version panel shows current device hardware/firmware versions (*via MON-VER and MON-HW polls*).
1. CFG Configuration Load/Save/Record facility. This allows users to record ![record icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-record-24.png?raw=true) a sequence of UBX CFG configuration commands, and to save ![save icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-save-14-24.png?raw=true) this recording to a file (as binary CFG-* messages). Saved files can be reloaded ![load icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-folder-18-24.png?raw=true) and the configuration commands replayed ![play icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-arrow-12-24.png?raw=true). This provides a means to easily reproduce a given sequence of configuration commands, or copy a saved configuration between compatible devices. The Configuration Load/Save/Record facility can accept configuration files in either binary UBX format (\*.ubx) or u-center text format (\*.txt). Files saved using the [ubxsave](#ubxsave) CLI utility (*installed via the `pygnssutils` library*) can also be reloaded and replayed. **Tip:** The contents of a binary config file can be reviewed using PyGPSClient's [file streaming facility](#filestream), *BUT* remember to set the `Msg Mode` in the Settings panel to `SET` rather than the default `GET` ![msgmode capture](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/msgmode.png?raw=true).
1. Protocol Configuration panel (CFG-PRT) sets baud rate and inbound/outbound protocols across all available ports.
1. Solution Rate panel (CFG-RATE) sets navigation solution interval in ms (e.g. 1000 = 1/second) and measurement ratio (ratio between the number of measurements and the number of navigation solutions, e.g. 5 = five measurements per navigation solution).
1. For each of the panels above, clicking anywhere in the panel background will refresh the displayed information with the current configuration.
1. Message Rate panel (CFG-MSG) sets message rates per port for UBX and NMEA messages. Message rate is relative to navigation solution frequency e.g. a message rate of '4' means 'every 4th navigation solution' (higher = less frequent).
1. UBX Legacy Command configuration panel providing structured updates for a range of legacy CFG-* configuration commands for pre-Generation 9+ devices. Note: 'X' (byte) type attributes can be entered as integers or hexadecimal strings e.g. 522125312 or 0x1f1f0000. Once a command is selected, the configuration is polled and the current values displayed. The user can then amend these values as required and send the updated configuration. Some polls require input arguments (e.g. portID) - these are highlighted and will be set at default values initially (e.g. portID = 0), but can be amended by the user and re-polled using the ![refresh](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-refresh-lined-24.png?raw=true) button.
1. Configuration Interface widget (CFG-VALSET, CFG-VALDEL and CFG-VALGET) queries and sets configuration for [Generation 9+ devices](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyubx2#configinterface) e.g. NEO-M9, ZED-F9P, etc.
1. Preset Commands widget supports a variety of preset and user-defined commands - see [user defined presets](#userdefined). The port checkboxes (USB, UART1, etc.) determine which device port(s) any preset message rate commands apply to (_assuming the selected ports are physically implemented on the device_). The selected port(s) may be saved as configuration parameter `defaultport_s` e.g. "USB,UART1".

warning ![warning icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-warning-1-24.png?raw=true)). 

**Note:**
* The UBX protocol does not support synchronous command acknowledgement or unique confirmation IDs. Asynchronous command and poll acknowledgements and responses can take several seconds at high message transmission rates, or be discarded altogether if the device's transmit buffer is full (*txbuff-alloc error*). To ensure timely responses, try increasing the baud rate and/or temporarily reducing transmitted message rates using the configuration commands provided.
* A warning icon (typically accompanied by an ACK-NAK response) is usually an indication that one or more of the commands sent is not supported by your receiver.

## <a name="nmeaconfig">NMEA Configuration Facilities</a>

![nmeaconfig widget screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/nmeaconfig_widget.png?raw=true)

**Pre-Requisites:**

- Receiver capable of being configured via proprietary NMEA sentences, connected to the workstation via USB or UART port. The facility includes support for several Quectel LG and LC series receivers via PQTM* and PAIR* sentences. Additional types may be supported in the underlying NMEA parser library [pynmeagps](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pynmeagps) in later releases (*contributions welcome*).

**Instructions:**

The NMEA Configuration Dialog currently provides the following NMEA configuration panels:
1. Version panel shows current device hardware/firmware versions (*via PQTMVERNO polls*).
1. Dynamic configuration panel providing structured updates for supported receivers e.g. Quectel LG290P via PQTM* sentences, or LC29H via PAIR* sentences. Once a command is selected, the configuration is polled and the current values displayed. The user can then amend these values as required and send the updated configuration. Some polls require input arguments (e.g. portid or msgname) - these are highlighted and will be set at default values initially (e.g. portid = 1), but can be amended by the user and re-polled using the ![refresh](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-refresh-lined-24.png?raw=true) button.
1. Preset Commands widget supports a variety of preset and user-defined commands - see [user defined presets](#userdefined).

![send icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-arrow-12-24.png?raw=true) button indicates the confirmation status of the configuration command; 
(pending i.e. awaiting confirmation ![pending icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-time-6-24.png?raw=true),

warning ![warning icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-warning-1-24.png?raw=true)).

**NB:** Several Quectel LG and LC series commands require a Hot Restart (PQTMHOT) before taking effect, including PQTMCFGCNST (Enable/Disable Constellations), PQTMCFGFIX (Configure Fix Rate), PQTMCFGSAT (Configure Satellite Masks) and PQTMCFGSIGNAL (Configure Signal Masks). This is a Quectel protocol constraint, not a PyGPSClient issue.

## <a name="ntripconfig">NTRIP Client Facilities</a>

![ntrip config widget screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/ntripconfig_widget.png?raw=true)

The NTRIP Configuration utility allows users to receive and process NTRIP RTK Correction data from an NTRIP caster to achieve cm level location accuracy. The facility can be accessed by clicking ![NTRIP Client button](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-antenna-4-24.png?raw=true) or selecting Menu..Options..NTRIP Configuration Dialog. 

**Pre-Requisites:**

- NTRIP-compatible GNSS receiver e.g. u-blox ZED-F9P
- Internet access
- URL of NTRIP caster
- Login credentials for the NTRIP caster (where required)
- Name of local MOUNTPOINT (if not using PyGPSClient's automatic mountpoint locator)
- Data type (normally RTCM but some services output data in SPARTN format)

**Instructions:**

1. Enter the required NTRIP server URL (or IP address), port (defaults to 2101) and HTTPS flag (defaults to 'yes' for ports 443/2102, 'no' for all else). For services which require authorisation, enter your login username and password.
1. Select the Data Type (defaults to RTCM, but can be set to SPARTN).
1. To retrieve the sourcetable, leave the mountpoint field blank and click connect (*response may take a few seconds*). The required mountpoint may then be selected from the list, or entered manually. Where possible, `PyGPSClient` will automatically identify the closest mountpoint to the current location.
1. For NTRIP services which require client position data via NMEA GGA sentences, select the appropriate sentence transmission interval in seconds. The default is 'None' (no GGA sentences sent). A value of 10 or 60 seconds is typical.
1. If GGA sentence transmission is enabled, GGA sentences can either be populated from live navigation data (*assuming a receiver is connected and outputting valid position data*) or from fixed reference settings entered in the NTRIP configuration panel (latitude, longitude, elevation and geoid separation - all four reference settings must be provided).
1. To connect to the NTRIP server, click ![connect icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-media-control-48-24.png?raw=true). To disconnect, click ![disconnect icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-media-control-50-24.png?raw=true).
1. If NTRIP data is being successfully received, the banner '**dgps:**' status indicator should change to 'YES' and indicate the age and reference station of the correction data (where available) ![dgps status](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/dgps_status.png?raw=true). Note that DGPS status is typically maintained for up to 60 seconds after loss of correction signal.
1. Some NTRIP services may output RTCM3 or SPARTN correction messages at a high rate, flooding the GUI console display. To suppress these messages in the console, de-select the 'RTCM' or'SPARTN' options in 'Protocols Shown' - the RTCM3 or SPARTN messages will continue to be processed in the background.

Below is a illustrative NTRIP DGPS data log, showing:
* Outgoing NMEA GPGGA (client position) sentence.
* Incoming RTCM3 correction messages; in this case - 1006 (Ref station ARP (*DF003=2690*) with antenna height), 1008 (Antenna descriptor), 1033 (Receiver descriptor), 1075 (GPS MSM5), 1085 (GLONASS MSM5), 1095 (Galileo MSM5), 1125 (BeiDou MSM5) and 1230 (GLONASS Code-Phase Biases)
* Corresponding UBX RXM-RTCM acknowledgements generated by the u-blox ZED-F9P receiver, confirming message type, valid checksum (*crcFailed=0*), successful use (*msgUsed=2*) and reference station ARP (*refStation=2690*). 

![ntrip console screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/ntrip_consolelog.png?raw=true)

**NB:** Please respect the terms and conditions of any remote NTRIP service used with this facility. For testing or evaluation purposes, consider deploying a local [SNIP LITE](https://www.use-snip.com/download/) server. *Inappropriate use of an NTRIP service may result in your account being blocked*.

---
## <a name="spartnconfig">SPARTN Client Facilities</a>

  ### NB: As of October 2025, u-blox have discontinued both their L-Band and MQTT encrypted SPARTN correction services, so the SPARTN Client functionality is effectively redundant and may be removed in a subsequent version of PyGPSClient.

  The SPARTN MQTT and L-Band configuration panels are now disabled by default, though the L-Band panel can in theory still be used for other generic L-Band modem configuration purposes and can be re-enabled by setting json configuration parameter `lband_enabled_b` to `1`.

Please refer to [SPARTN.md](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/SPARTN.md) for instructions.

---
## <a name="socketserver">Socket Server / NTRIP Caster Facilities</a>

The Socket Server / NTRIP Caster facility is capable of operating in either of two modes;
1. SOCKET SERVER - an open, unauthenticated TCP socket server available to any socket client including, for example, another instance of PyGPSClient or the [`gnssstreamer` CLI utility](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pygnssutils#gnssstreamer). In this mode it will broadcast the host's currently connected GNSS data stream (NMEA, UBX, SBF, RTCM3). The default port is 50012.
2. NTRIP CASTER - a simple implementation of an authenticated NTRIP caster available to any NTRIP client including, for example, PyGPSClient's NTRIP Client facility, [`gnssntripclient`](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pygnssutils#gnssntripclient) or BKG's [NTRIP Client (BNC)](https://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/download). Login credentials for the NTRIP caster are set via the `"ntripcasteruser_s":` and `"ntripcasterpassword_s":` settings in the *.json confirmation file (they can also be set via PyGPSClient command line arguments `--ntripcasteruser`, `--ntripcasterpassword`, or by setting environment variables `NTRIPCASTER_USER`, `NTRIPCASTER_PASSWORD`). Default settings are as follows: bind address: 0.0.0.0, port: 2101, mountpoint: pygnssutils, user: anon, password: password.

By default, the server/caster binds to the host address '0.0.0.0' (IPv4) or '::' (IPv6) i.e. all available IP addresses on the host machine. This can be overridden via the settings panel or a host environment variable `PYGPSCLIENT_BINDADDRESS`. A label on the settings panel indicates the number of connected clients, and the server/caster status is indicated in the topmost banner: running with no clients: ![transmit icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-noclient-10-24.png?raw=true), running with clients: ![transmit icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-transmit-10-24.png?raw=true).

**Pre-Requisites:**

1. Running in NTRIP CASTER mode is predicated on the host being connected to an RTK-compatible GNSS receiver **operating in Base Station mode** (either `FIXED` or `SURVEY_IN`) and outputting the requisite RTCM3 message types (1005/6, 1077, 1087, 1097, etc.). 
1. It may be necessary to add a firewall rule and/or enable port-forwarding on the host machine or router to allow remote traffic on the specified address:port.

**Instructions:**

**SOCKET SERVER MODE**

1. Select SOCKET SERVER mode and (if necessary) enter the host IP address and port.
1. Check the Socket Server/NTRIP Caster checkbox to activate the server.
1. To stop the server, uncheck the checkbox.

**NTRIP CASTER MODE**

1. Select NTRIP CASTER mode and (if necessary) enter the host IP address and port.
1. An additional expandable panel is made available to allow the user to configure a connected RTK-compatible receiver to operate in either `FIXED` or `SURVEY-IN` Base Station mode (*NB: parameters can only be amended while the caster is stopped*).
1. Select the receiver type (currently u-blox ZED-F9*, u-blox ZED-X20*, Quectel LG290P, Quectel LC29H (BA, and Septentrio Mosaic X5 receivers are supported) and click the Send button to send the appropriate configuration commands to the receiver. 
1. **NB** Septentrio Mosaic X5: These receivers are configured via ASCII TTY commands - to monitor the command responses, set the console protocol to "TTY" (*remember to set it back to RTCM when monitoring the RTCM3 output*). Note also that the input (ASCII command) UART port may be different to the output (RTCM3) UART port - make sure to select the appropriate port(s) when configuring the device and monitoring the RTCM3 output.
1. NMEA messages can be suppressed by checking 'Disable NMEA'.
1. NTRIP client login credentials are set via the user and password fields. 
1. Check the Socket Server/NTRIP Caster checkbox to activate the caster.
1. To stop the caster, uncheck the checkbox.

### <a name="basestation">Base Station Configuration</a>

| Configuration Settings | Base Station Mode    |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ![basestation config](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/basestation_fixed.png?raw=true) | **FIXED**. In this mode, the known base station coordinates (*Antenna Reference Point or ARP*) are specified in either LLH or ECEF (X,Y,Z) format. The coordinates are pre-populated with the receiver's current navigation solution (if available), but these can (and normally should) be overridden with accurately surveyed values. If the coordinates are accepted, the Fix status will change to `TIME ONLY` and the receiver will start outputting RTCM `1005` or `1006` (*Antenna Reference Point or ARP*) messages containing the base station location in ECEF (X,Y,Z) format. |
| ![basestation config](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/basestation_svin.png?raw=true)  | **SURVEY-IN**. In this mode, the base station coordinates are derived from the receiver's current navigation solution, provided the prescribed level of accuracy is met within the specified survey duration. If the survey is successful, the Fix status will change to `TIME ONLY` and the receiver will start outputting RTCM `1005` or `1006` messages containing the base station location in ECEF (X,Y,Z) format. The surveyed base station location will be updated from the position provided by these RTCM `1005` or `1006` messages.|
| ![basestation config](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/basestation_off.png?raw=true)  | **DISABLED**. Disable base station operation. |

**NB:** To operate effectively as an RTK Base Station, antenna positioning is of paramount importance. Refer to the following links for advice:
- [u-blox GNSS Antennas Paper](https://www.ardusimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GNSS-Antennas_AppNote_UBX-15030289.pdf)

## <a name="gpxviewer">GPX Track Viewer</a>

![gpxviewer screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/gpxviewer.png?raw=true)

*GPX Track Viewer screenshot*

The GPX Track Viewer can display any valid GPX file containing track point (`trkpt`), route point (`rtept`) or waypoint (`wpt`)elements against either an ["custom" offline map image](#custommap), or an online MapQuest "map", "sat" or "hyb" view. The "map", "sat" and "hyb" options require a free [MapQuest API key](#mapquestapi). The Y axis scales will reflect the current choice of units (metric or imperial). If the GPX track omits a time element, the time and speed axes will be flagged as nominal. GPX track metadata, including min, max, average (mean) and median elevation and speed values, is displayed in the selected units. 
Click ![refresh icon](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/src/pygpsclient/resources/iconmonstr-refresh-lined-24.png?raw=true) to refresh the display after any changes (e.g. resizing, zooming or change of units). The location marker indicates the nominal center point of the track.

---
## <a name="mapquestapi">MapQuest API Key</a>

**Pre-Requisites:**

To use the optional dynamic web-based mapview or GPX Track Viewer facilities, you need to request and install a 
[MapQuest API key](https://developer.mapquest.com/user/login/sign-up).

Note that, from January 15th 2024, MapQuest require payment card details for the use of this API, but the
first 15,000 transactions/month remain free. Usage above 15,000 transactions/month is charged at $.0045 per transaction. See
[FAQ](https://developer.mapquest.com/faq) for further information.

For this reason, the map refresh rate is intentionally limited to 1/minute* to avoid exceeding the free transaction limit under normal use. **NB:** this
facility is *not* intended to be used for real time navigational purposes.

**Instructions:**

Once you have received the API key (a 32-character alphanumeric string), you can (in order of precedence):

1. Copy it to the `"mqapikey_s":` value in your json configuration file (see example provided).
2. Create an environment variable named `MQAPIKEY` (all upper case) and set this to the API key value. It is recommended 
that this is a User variable rather than a System/Global variable.
3. Pass it via command line argument `--mqapikey`.

*The web map refresh rate can be amended if required by changing the `mapupdateinterval_n:` value in your json configuration file.

---
## <a name="userdefined">User Defined Presets</a>

The UBX and NMEA Configuration Dialogs include the facility to send user-defined configuration messages or message sequences to a compatible receiver. These can be set up by adding
appropriate comma- or semicolon-delimited message descriptions and payload definitions to the `"ubxpresets_l":`or `"nmeapresets_l":` lists in your json configuration file (see [example provided](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/pygpsclient.json#L174)). The message definition comprises a free-format text description (*avoid embedded commas or semi-colons*) followed by one or more pyubx2 (UBX) or pynmeagps (NMEA) message constructors, e,g. 

- UBX - `<description>, <message class>, <message id>, <payload as hexadecimal string>, <msgmode>`
- NMEA - `<description>; <talker>; <message id>; <payload as comma-separated string>; <msgmode>`

If the command description contains the term `CONFIRM`, a pop-up confirmation box will appear before the command is actioned.

The `pygpsclient.ubx2preset()` and `pygpsclient.nmea2preset()` helper functions may be used to convert a `UBXMessage` or `NMEAMessage` object into a preset string suitable for copying and pasting into the `"ubxpresents_l":` or `"nmeapresets_l":` JSON configuration sections:

```python
from pygpsclient import ubx2preset, nmea2preset
from pyubx2 import UBXMessage
from pynmeagps import NMEAMessage, SET

ubx = UBXMessage("CFG", "CFG-MSG", SET, msgClass=0x01, msgID=0x03, rateUART1=1)
print(ubx2preset(ubx, "Configure NAV-STATUS Message Rate on ZED-F9P"))

nmea = NMEAMessage("P", "QTMCFGUART", SET, baudrate=460800)
print(nmea2preset(nmea, "Configure UART baud rate on LG290P"))
```
```
Configure NAV-STATUS Message Rate on ZED-F9P, CFG, CFG-MSG, 0103000100000000, 1
Configure UART baud rate on LG290P; P; QTMCFGUART; W,460800; 1
```

Multiple commands can be concatenated on a single line. Illustrative examples are shown in the sample [pygpsclient.json](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/pygpsclient.json#L174) file.

## <a name="ttycommands">TTY Commands and Presets</a>

![ttydialog screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/tty_dialog.png?raw=true)

The TTY Commands dialog provides a facility to send user-defined ASCII TTY commands (e.g. `AT+` style commands) to the connected serial device. Commands can be entered manually or selected from a list of user-defined presets. The dialog can be accessed via menu bar Options...TTY Commands. 
- CRLF checkbox - if ticked, a CRLF (`b"\x0d\x0a"`) terminator will be added to the command string. 
- Echo checkbox - if ticked, outgoing TTY commands will be echoed on the console with the marker `"TTY<<"`.
- Delay checkbox - if ticked, a small delay will be added between each outgoing command to allow time for the receiving device to process the command.

Preset commands can be set up by adding appropriate semicolon-delimited message descriptions and payload definitions to the `"ttypresets_l":` list in your json configuration file (see [example provided](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/pygpsclient.json#L255)). The message definition comprises a free-format text description (*avoid embedded semi-colons*) followed by one or more ASCII TTY commands, e,g. 

- `<description>; <tty command>`

The following example illustrates a series of ASCII configuration commands being sent to a Septentrio Mosaic X5 receiver, followed by successful acknowledgements:

![ttyconsole screenshot](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient/blob/master/images/tty_console.png?raw=true)

---
## <a name="cli">Command Line Utilities</a>

The `pygnssutils` and `pyubxutils` libraries which underpin many of the functions in `PyGPSClient` also incorporate command line versions of these functions:

1. `gnssstreamer` CLI utility. This is essentially a configurable input/output wrapper around the [`pyubx2.UBXReader`](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyubx2#reading) class with flexible message formatting and filtering options for NMEA, UBX and RTCM3 protocols.
1. `gnssserver` CLI utility. This implements a TCP Socket Server for GNSS data streams which is also capable of being run as a simple NTRIP Server.
1. `gnssntripclient` CLI utility. This implements a simple NTRIP Client which receives RTCM3 correction data from an NTRIP Server and (optionally) sends this to a
designated output stream.
1. `gnssmqttclient` CLI utility. This implements a simple SPARTN IP (MQTT) Client which receives SPARTN and UBX correction data from a SPARTN IP location service (e.g. u-blox / Thingstream PointPerfect) and (optionally) sends this to a designated output stream.
1. <a name="ubxsave">`ubxsave` CLI utility</a>. This saves a complete set of configuration data from any Generation 9+ u-blox device (e.g. NEO-M9N or ZED-F9P) to a file. The file can then be reloaded to any compatible device using the `ubxload` utility.
1. `ubxload` CLI utility. This reads a file containing binary configuration data and loads it into any compatible Generation 9+ u-blox device (e.g. NEO-M9N or ZED-F9P).
1. `ubxsetrate` CLI utility. A simple utility which sets NMEA or UBX message rates on u-blox GNSS receivers.
1. `ubxbase` CLI utility. This configures an RTK-compatible UBX receiver (e.g. the ZED-F9P) to operate in Base Station mode.

For further details, refer to the `pygnssutils` homepage at [https://github.com/semuconsulting/pygnssutils](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pygnssutils) or `pyubxutils` homepage at [https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyubxutils](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyubxutils).

## <a name="knownissues">Known Issues</a>

1. Most budget USB-UART adapters (e.g. FT232, CH345, CP2102) have a bandwidth limit of around 3MB/s and may not work reliably above 115200 baud, even if the receiver supports higher baud rates. If you're using an adapter and notice significant message corruption, try reducing the baud rate to a maximum 115200.

2. As of October 2025, u-blox have [discontinued their PointPerfect SPARTN L-Band and MQTT services](https://portal.u-blox.com/s/question/0D5Oj00000uB53GKAS/suspension-of-european-pointperfect-lband-spartn-service). As a result, PyGPSClient's [SPARTN Configuration](#spartnconfig) panel is largely redundant and is disabled by default in version>=1.5.17, though it can be re-enabled by manually setting the `lband_enabled_b` configuration setting to 1.

3. Some Homebrew-installed Python environments on MacOS can give rise to critical segmentation errors (*illegal memory access*)  when shell subprocesses are invoked, due to the way permissions are implemented. This may, for example, affect About..Update functionality; the workaround is to update via a standard CLI `pip install --upgrade` command.

4. Installing the optional `rasterio` package in some Python 3.14 environments (e.g. MacOS) may result in `ERROR: A GDAL API version must be specified. Provide a path to gdal-config using a GDAL_CONFIG environment variable or use a GDAL_VERSION environment variable`. This is due to a pre-compiled bdist (wheel) distribution not yet being available for Python 3.14 on these platforms. This is likely to be resolved once Python 3.14 beds in - in the meantime, reverting to Python 3.13 resolves the issue.

5. On some 32-bit Linux platforms (e.g. Raspberry Pi OS 32), it may be necessary to [install Rust compiler support](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and some [additional build dependencies](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/) in order to install the `cryptography` library which PyGPSClient optionally depends on to decrypt SPARTN messages (see  [pyspartn cryptography installation notes](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyspartn/tree/main/cryptography_installation#readme)):

   ```shell
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev pkg-config
   ```
